Source Finagler
==============

**Source Finagler 2.0.3**

System Requirements: Mac OS X 10.5.x or later

Build Requirements: This Source Finagler 2.0.3 project is intended to produce a universal Intel executable (both 32-bit and 64-bit) that is capable of running on OS X 10.5.x. To achieve such a result, I'm using Xcode 3.2.6 with GCC 4.2.






Source Finagler is a Mac OS X app designed to enhance the integration of [Valve Software's Steam.app](http://store.steampowered.com) client and games for OS X. Some of its key features are:

 * A native Mac-equivalent of [GCFScape](http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=25) that allows you to browse the contents of Valve's game cache files using a Finder-like interface. You can preview items in the game cache files using QuickLook, and extract the contents using a drag-and-drop interface.
 
 * Assists in relocating the `SteamApps` folder (where games are stored) to a different location by creating the Steam Apps shortcut (symbolic link).
 
 * "Helps" Source-based games so other Mac OS X applications can properly recognize them as Mac OS X applications. (Use this with apps like USB Overdrive, SteerMouse, Logitech Control Center, etc.).
 
 * Provides Spotlight and QuickLook plugins for Valve Source Texture Images (.vtf) and Microsoft DDS (.dds) images.
