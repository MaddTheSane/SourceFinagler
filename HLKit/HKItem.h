    Generic Tree node structure (TreeNode).
    
    TreeNode is a node in a doubly linked tree data structure.  TreeNode's have weak references to their parent (to avoid retain 
    cycles since parents retain their children).  Each node has 0 or more children and a reference to a piece of node data. The TreeNode provides method to manipulate and extract structural information about a tree.  For instance, TreeNode implements: insertChild:atIndex:, removeChild:, isDescendantOfNode:, and other useful operations on tree nodes.
    TreeNode provides the structure and common functionality of trees and is expected to be subclassed.
